## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing provides access to various computing services like servers, storage and software over the internet (“the cloud”).

Companies that provide these computing services are known as cloud providers and generally bill for cloud computing based on usage, much like how you are charged for gas or electricity at home.

## Why Cloud Computing?

### Pre-Cloud Era - On Premise Solution

Process:

- Purchase a Laptop/PC
- Install the Development Environment
- Deploy the Application
- Configure Network Settings

Problems:

- High Initial Costs
- Downtime Risks
- Performance Bottlenecks
- Security Challenges
- Update and Maintenance

Organizations relied on traditional on-premises infrastructure to meet their computing requirements.

- Invest on physical site or location
- Invest in purchasing physical hardware like servers, switches, routers, storage, backup devices, ethernet cables, etc.
- Hire IT engineers to setup and manage physical devices.
- Spend on 24/7 Electricity, cooling and ensuring backup
- What if traffic increases on any application hosted on physical server
- Upgrade/replace expired physical devices.

Cloud providers such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud build and maintain data centres equipped with advanced servers.

- Powerful CPUs, lots of memory, disk storage, etc, are available to users.

Why run applications on cloud and not on on-premise “bare metal” servers?

- Multiplexing gains: multiple virtual machines (VMs) can share the system resources
- No/Low overhead of maintenance: hardware/software maintained by providers
- Flexibility: VMs can move to another machine if one fails
- Pay as per usage: no need to invest in servers

Disadvantages of running applications on cloud

- May experience longer delay to access servers via internet.
- Higher cost if heavily used.

## A Very Brief History of Cloud Computing

1950’s: Concept of time-sharing and utility computing introduced by John McCarthy.

1972: IBM developed virtual machines allowing multiple operating systems on one hardware.

1997: Cloud computing term first coined by professor Ramnath Chellappa.

1999: Salesforce launched, offering Software as a Service (SaaS).

2002: Amazon Web Services (AWS) introduced, providing storage services.

2006: Amazon Launched Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) offering scalable compute capacity.

2008: Google launched Google App Engine for cloud-hosted applications.

2010: Microsoft launched Azure, entering the cloud infrastructure market.

2011: IBM introduced SmartCloud, marking its cloud entry.

2014: Google introduced Kubernetes, revolutionizing cloud-native container orchestration.

2020’s: Multi-Cloud and hybrid cloud strategies gain popularity, with edge computing and AI.
