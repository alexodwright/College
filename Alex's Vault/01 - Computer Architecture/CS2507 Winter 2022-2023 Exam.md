## Question 1

### A.
Doubling the processor's clock speed doubles single threaded performance and enhances responsiveness for tasks that can't be parallelized.

Doubling the cores in a processor doubles the multi threaded tasks and increases the performance of tasks that can be parallelized. However it doesn't double the overall performance due to the overhead communication between the multiple cores and the computing power used to split the task into parallelizable pieces and synchronize them together.

### B.
'Smaller is faster' is one of the MIPS processor design principles. This is evident in MIPS with it's RISC (Reduced Instruction Set) Computer Architecture.

MIPS has 32 registers which allows each register to be identified with only 5 bits. If MIPS had more registers we would have more memory but also a longer fetch instruction time as the identifier would be more complex. 

MIPS also has a fixed instruction size of 32 bits which allows the fetch decode execute take approximately 1.5 clock cycles. A smaller and more primitive instruction set allows MIPS to operate faster than a CISC architecture such as x86 Intel or AMD.

### C.
4 bytes are allocated to x2

15.25 = 01000001011101000000000000000000 in binary

### D.
32 registers - faster but less memory - manual register management

risc - more primitive instruction set but faster.

### E.
The execution time is inversely proportional to the number of pipelining stages.

However the pipelining depth is more complex and requires more hardware to implement which also increases power consumption.

#### F.
Associativity
