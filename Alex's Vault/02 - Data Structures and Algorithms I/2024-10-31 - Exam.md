## Question 1

You would choose the function that has a time complexity of O(n log n). The amount of code does not make a significant difference whereas the time complexity of the function does. You should always try to reduce the time complexity of a function even if this means the code is longer. The first function increases quadratically which does not scale well with size. However the other function scales logarithmically which scales better with size.

## Question 2

```Python
a
y
c
p
s
d
```

## Question 3

The four standard methods of the Queue ADT are:
- Enqueue
- Dequeue
- Front
- Length

```Python
def enqueue(self, item):
	'''
	This method adds an item to the back of the queue. It is the furthest
	element from the front of the queue. The parameters for this method
	are the queue itself (self) and the item we wish to add to the back
	of the queue (item).
	'''
	return None

def dequeue(self):
	'''
	This method dequeues the item at the front of the queue and returns
	it. The parameters for this function are the queue itself (self).
	'''
	return self.body[0]

def front(self):
	'''
	This method reports and returns the item at the front of the queue
	(i.e. the item that has been in the queue the longest). It does not
	remove the item at the front like dequeue.
	'''
	return self.body[0]

def length(self):
	'''
	This method returns the length of the queue as an integer
	'''
	return len(self.body)
```

## Question 4

Accessing by index is O(1) as you have the address of the first element in the array and you also have the size of each cell in the array. By performing simple arithmetic you can calculate the index of any element by the following formula: $A(0) + (i\times S)$ where A(0) is the address of the first element, i is the index you are accessing and S is the size of a cell in the array.

Appending to a list is on average O(1) time complexity because there is no need to shift the other bits around, you are only adding to the end of the last memory address for the array. In the event that the array needs to grow, this is done seldomly and averages out to O(1).

Popping from the end is just as simple as you are just removing the last index of the array. There is no need to shift the bits around therefore this is also O(1).

## Question 5

```Python
def add_after(item, nodebefore):
	new_node = DLLNode(item, nodebefore, nodebefore._next)
	nodebefore._next._prev = new_node
	nodebefore._next = new_node
```
