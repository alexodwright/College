## Algorithms

Algorithms: the abstract specification of the processes that are running on all of our computers, phones, games consoles, databases, autopilots, banking, systems, autonomous vehicles, networks,…

Algorithms process information maintained in data structures, and produce actions and results.

## Data Structures

Data structures: the frameworks we use to maintain the data that are processed by the algorithms.  
Inside data structures, we use algorithms to manipulate the data efficiently.  

## Abstract Data Types

Abstract Data Types: Higher level patterns for interacting with data structures - patterns for reading data from the structure, for removing data, and for adding new data.

An ADT does not specify how an underlying data structure should be implemented.

### Questions

Does it do what it is supposed to do?

How long will it take?

How much space (memory) does it need to run?

How do we implement it?

### What is the point?

1. Your programs must be correct
    1. not just bug-free code, but implementing an algorithm that does exactly what it is supposed to do.
2. Your programs should be efficient
    1. Programs that take too long to run are useless
    2. Understand the implication of choosing different library functions
    3. Understand the implication of choosing different design patterns
        1. What may be easier for you to code may be much worse to run
3. You must be able to advertise your code to other programmers in terms they will understand
    1. State what abstract data types you are using
        1. Programmers then know how to interact with them
    2. State what data structures and algorithms you have used to implement them
        1. Programmers then know how efficient different interactions would be
4. You should only use external code as specified
    1. Understand the specified ways to interact with the data
    2. Don’t interact with it in other ways
        1. Abandons correctness and efficiency
    3. Be disciplined in your coding.
