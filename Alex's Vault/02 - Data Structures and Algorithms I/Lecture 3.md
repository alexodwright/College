## Python Data types

Integers, Floats, Booleans - a variable of any of these types takes a single value at a time, and allows particular operations - e.g. division, comparison, …

When we type x = 3 we are telling Python that x refers to a variable of type Integer, and it has a value 3

Lists - a variable of this type maintains a sequence of other variables.

### Lists under the hood

Python specifies how a list behaves using an internal class definition. The class definition is a piece of code.

A list stores multiple items in numbered positions. You can add new items onto the end, read or change the value stored in a specified position.

You can ask a list how many items it has, reverse its order, etc.

## Objects

We can create individual objects from the class design. This is the same idea as creating individual variables corresponding to a data type.

We can update the values assigned to them.

We can run processes on them.

Ask x if it should be scheduled before y.

It must compare its priority with y’s priority.
