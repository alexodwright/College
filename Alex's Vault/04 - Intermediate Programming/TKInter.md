## What is TKInter

- TKInter is a light weight framework for developing user interfaces in Python
- Ships with Python
- Cross platform
- Simple

- Looks a 'bit old school'
- Coding is simple but relatively unsophisticated
	- Can be long winded and repetitive

## Parts of an Interface

- The basic components in the library are:
	- Basic Frame
	- Widgets (such as buttons, labels, lists, etc.)
	- Layouts
	- Event handlers and event loop
- To implement, we must:
	- Import components
	- Add components (widgets) into a layout
	- Add event handlers for widgets
	- Enter an event loop where we depart from the normal flow of control and enter an event driven model.
## Event Driven Program

- **Event-driven programming** is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses).
- Events are generated by the operating system and passed to the running application where they are translated into object instances (Event).
	- Here they are used to trigger event handlers where the event can be passed and values about the event accessed.
## Creating a Frame
```Python
import tkinter as tk # add the import

root = tk.Tk() # creating a frame object
root.geometry('400x400') # simple formatting

root.mainloop() # enter the event loop
```

- We create the frame and configure it
	- This creates a frame that can contain content
	- Even with just this call we have a frame that can be resized, closed, maximized, etc. It also has a title.
- The event loop is entered with the main loop call.
	- At this point, the programs flow of control becomes dependent on user actions rather than executing sequentially.
## Adding Components

```Python
L1 = tk.Label(root, text='Some text') # adds a label to the root
									  # initializes with some text
L1.pack() # simple layout to add to frame

btn = tk.Button(root, text='OK') # adds a button
btn.pack()
```

## Event Handler

```Python
def onclick():
	L1.config(text = 'Modified Text') # the function that is called
									  # when the button is pressed
									  # in this case updating the label

***
btn = tk.Button(root, text='OK', command=onclick)
# we modify the button to name the method called when the button is pressed
```
## But there is more...

- To develop advanced code, we use designs or patterns of development - these are known as **Design Patterns**
- These are established approaches for organising code for typical operations that we might have to implement
	- 'Design patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software' by Gamma, Vlissides, Helm and Johnson - also known as the 'Gang of Four Book'
	- Often in a discussion in software company, you might be told to approach a problem using a particular pattern.
## Design Patterns

- One pattern is called Model View Controller
	- It seeks to achieve a 'separation of concerns' - essentially decoupling the data representation from the interface.
	- This makes it easy to present different views of the data to different apps.
- The Model is responsible for managing data in the application. It is manipulated by the controller and provides information to the view.
- The controller receives inputs from the user, validates those and makes changes to the model.
- The view presents information to the user - several views of the same data can be presented.
