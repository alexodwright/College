# Continuous Assessment

1. Experimental evaluation of graph algorithms
	1. Run experiments to observe the performance of different implementations of specified graph algorithms
	2. Submit written report on runtimes, working code for running the experiments, and working code for the algorithms.
	3. The algorithm code does not need to be your own (but it is better if it is), but all code sources must be fully cited.
	4. The early labs will cover performance evaluation methods for other algorithms
	5. Mid-semester labs with cover graph implementations
	6. Expected submission deadline around 8-10
